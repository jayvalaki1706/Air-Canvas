# Air-Canvas
This repository contains a Python-based implementation of an "Air Canvas" application using the OpenCV library. The Air Canvas allows users to draw and paint in the air using hand gestures captured through a webcam.
# Features:
Hand Gesture Recognition: Utilizes the MediaPipe library to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
Drawing Interface: Offers a dynamic drawing interface where hand gestures translate into drawing actions.
Multi-color Drawing: Supports multiple colors for drawing, with the ability to switch colors on-the-fly using hand gestures.
Canvas Controls: Includes controls for clearing the canvas and selecting different drawing colors through specific hand gestures.
# How it works:
Hand Tracking: Utilizes the MediaPipe Hands module to detect hand landmarks from the webcam feed.
Gesture-based Drawing: Interprets specific hand movements to initiate drawing actions, switch colors, and control the canvas.
Real-time Visualization: Displays both the live webcam feed and the canvas in separate windows, showing the drawing process in real-time.
# Setup and Usage:
Requirements: Ensure Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and required dependencies are installed.
Execution: Run the provided Python script to start the Air Canvas application.
Usage: Follow on-screen instructions to draw in the air, switch colors, and clear the canvas using hand gestures.
Exit: Close the application by pressing 'q' in the window displaying the live webcam feed.
